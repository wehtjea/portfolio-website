      <p>Hi! My name is Ashley Wehtje and I am a Chicago based UX Designer. <br><br>
        I started my career in human resources specializing in recruiting. Iâ€™ve spent the last 7 years in the healthcare and restaurant industries. Through thoughtful interview questions I was able to learn about candidates and their backgrounds. I am able to connect with people by being an active listener and turning an interview into a comfortable conversation. </p>
